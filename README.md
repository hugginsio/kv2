`kv2` is a versioned, encrypted, key-value secrets manager for the homelab. This module provides the server and client components, as well as the reference CLI implementation. The `kv2` server is:

- **Simple**: available as a single binary or Docker container. The only interface is a REST API.
- **Lightweight**: the simplicity of the service allows it to run almost anywhere, such as free tier VMs on hyperscale providers.
- **Secure**: secrets are encrypted at rest, and the server is designed to integrate with [Tailscale][0] for controlling API access.

While these traits make `kv2` perfect for my homelab, it may not be suitable for production environments.
